        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we evaluated the performance of our fine-tuned GPT-2 model using the BLEU metric. The evaluation was conducted against a random sample of movie quotes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Comparison**: The BLEU score for our fine-tuned model was compared to the vanilla GPT-2 (medium) model on the same dataset. Interestingly, our fine-tuned model performed worse than the vanilla GPT-2.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Possible Causes**:\n",
        "  - This result may be due to improper training or the quality of the dataset used.\n",
        "  - Alternatively, it could be a random fluke given the small sample size.\n",
        "  - Another possibility is the limitation of BLEU itself, as it might not fully capture the nuances of dialogue generation or conversational models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Further analysis and improvements in training or evaluation may be necessary to better understand these results."
