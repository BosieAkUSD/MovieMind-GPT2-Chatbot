# Cinematic Conversations: GPT-2 Powered Movie Expert Chatbot

## Project Overview
Welcome to **Cinematic Conversations**, a chatbot designed to discuss movies and answer movie-related questions with expert-level insights. This project leverages transfer learning to fine-tune the GPT-2 model using the Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus, allowing the chatbot to engage users with dialogue reminiscent of characters from popular films. With rich metadata, the chatbot can provide deeper contextual responses, making for a more engaging user experience.

The end goal is to create a user-friendly web interface where anyone can interact with this movie expert chatbot and explore cinematic conversations.
