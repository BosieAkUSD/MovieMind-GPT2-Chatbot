    "# Final Team Project for AAI - 520\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Final Team Project for AAI - 520 will assess your ability to design and implement a generative-based chatbot using state-of-the-art architectures and techniques. You will be assigned to a group/team by your instructor. It is **REQUIRED** that you and your team use GitHub as a code hosting platform to manage version control and measure collaboration during this project. Creating and adding a README file to your GitHub repository is also necessary. You should follow the [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) in the final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Build a chatbot that can carry out multi-turn conversations, adapt to context, and handle a variety of topics.  \n",
    "**Output:** A web or app interface where users can converse with the chatbot. *(30 bonus points)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic understanding of deep learning and neural networks.\n",
    "- Familiarity with a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).\n",
    "- Basic knowledge of web development (for the interface).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Research and Study Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "- Study generative-based chatbot architectures like Seq2Seq, Transformers, and GPT.\n",
    "- Understand the challenges of chatbot design: context management, coherency, handling ambiguous queries, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Collection and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose one of the following datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 1:** Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus [Link](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html)\n",
    "  - Preprocess data: tokenization, handling different languages (if applicable), and managing context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Model Design and Training\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose an architecture (e.g., Transformer-based models or deep learning models).\n",
    "- Implement or leverage existing implementations to train the model with the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Groupwork Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The final teamwork project is an essential component of our courses in the AAI program. This project is representative of the kind of collaborative project you may work on during your career and real-world projects. A significant portion of your final grade is drawn from your participation in this final group project, so you are strongly encouraged to work within your team and ensure each team member contributes equally to the final project deliverables. Team members should plan to have clear and ongoing communication with other members and engage with the project and its deliverables each week. Lack of participation and engagement with both your team and your final project can result in a failing grade for the course. While these are the expectations for the project work, if you do experience difficulty with project advancement or challenges with team dynamics, contact your instructor for assistance promptly. If you are unable to perform the project as a team, contact your instructor to explore pursuing the entire final project independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Module 2 (by the end of Week 2):** The course instructor will group students into teams of two to three members. Canvas, USD Email, or Slack can be used to find prospective team members.\n",
    "- **Module 4 (by the end of Week 4):** Each team's representative will need to submit the \"Team Project Status Update Form.\"\n",
    "- **Module 7 (by the end of Week 7):** Each team should submit deliverables for the course project in the final week:\n",
    "  - Working generative chatbot\n",
    "  - GitHub link\n",
    "  - Brief report\n",
    "  - Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is critical to note that no extensions will be given for any of the final project's due dates for any reason, and final projects submitted after the final due date will not be graded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final project submission, it is required to use GitHub. Ensure that you will create a dedicated repository for your project and use this for all your submissions. Embracing this approach will not only streamline our assessment process but will also equip you with a vital skill set valued in the tech industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission within Canvas will contain the following deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A link to the final project's GitHub repository.**\n",
    "2. **A working generative chatbot** accessible via Notebook and/or accessible through a web interface (include the link in your submission and report). Your Notebook should be in PDF or HTML format.\n",
    "3. **A brief report** in PDF detailing:\n",
    "   - Challenges faced and solutions implemented.\n",
    "   - Model architecture and rationale behind the chosen design.\n",
    "   - Evaluation results and user feedback.\n",
    "   - Future improvements and scalability options.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Write and submit your final project report in APA 7 style (sample professional paper). The final report (without Appendices), including text and selected tables/graphs, should be 3-5 pages. You will use the naming convention `Final Project Report-Team Number.pdf` (e.g., `Final Project Report-Team 1.pdf`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Presentation:** For the completion of your final project, students will be required to prepare and record a presentation that unfolds in the form of a captivating story, detailing their development, findings, and any relevant recommendations or conclusions. Visuals are required in the video presentation, which should be 5-7 minutes. A demo of your chatbot and how it works is recommended. This presentation should also include one slide to showcase your collaborative efforts; you will create a slide highlighting each team member's individual names and their contributions to the final project work and deliverables.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Note: It is recommended that you follow Garr Reynoldsâ€™ [advice](http://www.garrreynolds.com/preso-tips/) on how to design effective presentations. Since this presentation is a narrated presentation, it is a best practice to create a script beneath each slide in speaker notes if in PowerPoint or on an external document if screen capturing using other software. The scripts will help you when recording the narration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one member of your team will need to submit these deliverables.\n"
